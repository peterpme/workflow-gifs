# Upload your workflows

This is an experiment to see if sharing workflows is a worthwhile experience!

I use [Licecap](https://github.com/lepht/licecap) to record gifs

Workflows:

- peterpme
  - spotlight, iterm2, slate window management, tmux, vim, chrome
  - ![peterpme workflow](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ppiekarczyk/workflow-gifs/master/peterpme-workflow.gif)
